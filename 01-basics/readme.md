## ðŸ§  Notes

- fmt: format package which is used for formatted I/O,
- A name is exported if it begins with a capital letter.
- While importing a package, you can only refer to the exported name. Any "unexported" names are not accessible outside the package.
- A return statement without arguments returns the named return values. This is known as a "naked" return.
- You have to explicitly define the type of the return values.
- `:=` is a oper ator to define the variable in short instead of the usual `var variable_name type = value`
- `:=` can only be used for new variable.
- var is used for declaring variables and a var can be declared on both package and function level.
- `:=` is not available outside a function since every statement starts with a keyword.
- data types are int, string, bool, uint, complex, float.
- default value for a varible is 0/false/"" if not explicitly specified.
- Go only has for loop, the init and post statements in the for loop are optional.
