This repository contains practice scripts and concise learning notes from my Go (Golang) journey.

I‚Äôm following official Go resources like [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome) and [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) as my primary references, but all notes and examples are rewritten in my own words.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These notes are **not teaching material**. They're made to **help me retain and revisit tricky concepts**, not to explain beginner-level terms. If you're looking for definitions like "What is a slice?" ‚Äî this isn't the right place.

## üß† About This Repo

- Each topic is in its own folder (e.g., `01`, `02`, etc.), with:
  - A `README.md` summarizing important points.
  - A `Problems/` subfolder containing related practice scripts.
- The goal is to keep both theory and code well organized.
- Notes are intentionally concise, focusing on areas I found tricky or worth revisiting.

## üìå How to Use This Repo

- Browse by folder/topic.
- Use the topic-level READMEs as quick-reference notes.
- Run the practice scripts locally to solidify your understanding.

## ü§ù Contributions

This is a personal learning project, so I'm **not accepting pull requests right now** ‚Äî but you're welcome to fork or use it for your own study.

**I‚Äôll keep updating this as I move through Go.**
